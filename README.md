Face-recognition-brain is a full-stack web app for detecting faces in images using AI, providing an intuitive interface built with React that connects to a Node/Express backend. 
The front end allows users to seamlessly submit images and view facial recognition results, with bounding boxes highlighting detected faces via integration with the Clarifai API.
The app simply coordinates the client, server, database, and API, registering users with encrypted passwords, processing submissions, and tracking metrics. 
The tech stack demonstrates the use of React, Node, PostgreSQL, and external APIs, with face recognition happening rapidly through optimized calls to Clarifai's computer vision models.
